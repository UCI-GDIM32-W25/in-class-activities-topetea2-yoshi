## Week 1: In class activities

## Activity 1
1. Don't procrastinate on weekly minigame assignments and submit it on time. 
2. Make sure you have enough storage on your computer.
3. Ask the professor for help during office hours or the TA's for extra help.

## Activity 2

Q1. 10 is the value


Q2. Since the code is a repeated loop, the value will be 2.


Q3. Prints out hello world once you run the code. 


Q4. MonoBehavior 


Q5. X = 10 is going to print at the start of the game


Q6. int = 10 is our parameter and "x = " + X is a Debug.log method that will be printed out on the console.  


Q7. The code is using a datatype value, which will not compile once we run the game. 


Q8. We change Transform to _playerTransform in order to fix the error.

# Week 4

Activity 0


Partner: Ruth Sun


## Activity 1: 

When mutiple locators are set in the scene, most of the gameobjects loses its script once the game runs. In our code we wrote "Locator.Awake()," which deletes the extra "Locator" scripts from some of the components, leaving only one script in the scene.
